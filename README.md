The goal is to implement topics I'm learning in Computer Science at university via code

Such as learning databases? Let's not just learn SQL and normalization, let's also build our own SQL Engine. Or learning about LLMs? Let's build one.

- `AI`: machine learning, data science, language models
- `computer-graphics`: not really implementations from scratch as I'll rely on [ThreeJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three.js)
- `computer-networks`: network programming, protocols
- `crypto`: blockchain, cryptographic algorithms
- `DSA`: data structures and algorithms
- `foundations`: recursive thinking, functional programming, OOP
- `mathematics`: math notes and implementations in python
- `PLT`: programming language theory, compilers, interpreters
- `sys-computer`: toy projects in C and assembly, x86 architecture, CPU and memory
- `sys-databases`: database design and implementation
- `sys-web-systems`: multi-node, distributed systems, web systems infrastructure
- `sys-operating-systems`: threads, VM, processes, file system programming
